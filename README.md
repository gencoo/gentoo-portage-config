# Gentoo Portage config files

Attempt to build a fully working LLVM+musl+Linux system with
Gentoo (no GNU toolchains and runtime libraries allowed).

~~GNU+Linux~~

I'm doing this for fun to prove that a Linux Desktop is possible
without using GNU tools.

## Done and working on my machineâ„¢

 - [x] LLVM/clang as default system compiler (can compile 95% of my system) [GNU equivalent: gcc/g++]
 - [x] LLVM/lld as default ELF linker (can link 98% of my system) [GNU equivalent: ld.bfd or ld.gold]
 - [x] LLVM/libc++ and libc++abi as default C++ runtime library (works for 99% of packages) [GNU equivalent: libstdc++]
 - [x] LLVM/libunwind as default stack unwinding library [GNU equivalent: libgcc_s (s for stack)]
 - [x] LLVM/compiler-rt as default compiler routines library [GNU equivalent: libgcc]
 - [x] LLVM/openmp as default openmp library [GNU equivalent: gomp (g as in GNU)]

## work in progress

 - [ ] replace GNU/glibc with musl
 - [ ] find GNU/coreutils replacement which is compatible (command line arguments)

side note: I plan to keep GPL licensed packages and keep GNU/bash as my default shell.
(assuming it works with musl)

## Problems

#### Packages which refuse to work with a non-GNU setup

 - `dev-db/mariadb` (compiles and links, but segfaults at startup instantly due to libunwind)
 - `app-office/libreoffice` (doesn't compile with libc++, missing removed features)
 - `sys-libs/db` (Oracle DB library), USE flagged - get rid of this library entirely\
    (you can't expect from Oracle to add libc++ support, naming conflicts and std:: poisoning)
 - `sys-apps/gsmartcontrol` (naming conflicts with libc++)
 - `media-libs/id3lib` (naming conflicts with libc++, adds non-standard extensions to the std:: namespace)\
    (the dev tried to "polyfill" C++ features xD)
 - `dev-qt/qtwebengine` (compiles and links, but constantly crashes; only very basic stuff works)


#### Packages which can't be linked with LLVM/lld

 - `media-video/mpv`
 - `media-sound/sonic-visualiser`
 - `dev-util/cutter`
 - `media-libs/rubberband`
 - `dev-python/matplotlib`
 - `app-emulation/libvirt` (requires explicit linkage to libunwind, works without issues then)

can be fully compiled with my LLVM toolchain, but the last step requires GNU/gold to produce working ELF files


#### Packages with can't be compiled with clang

Some C++ programs and libraries use narrowing, which throws an error with clang.
gcc silently allows this. Workaround: add `-Wno-c++11-narrowing` to the compiler flags
for that package.

X11 drivers act faulty when compiled with clang on my machine. X11 crashes with no backtrace.

Qt Web Engine

This heavy abomination can be built with my LLVM-based toolchain, but doesn't work
at runtime correctly. Basic stuff works, like the Qt Help Browser in Qt Creator, or
the memory viewer in KSysGuard. Some simple websites can be visited too, but as soon as JavaScript
or HTML5 media kicks in I get an instant crash with no backtrace. I assume backtrace
generation is only supported with `libgcc_s`, but not with `libunwind` :thinking:
Literally undebuggable right now, need to investigate this at some point.

Output (no backtrace as you can see):

```plain
Received signal: 6
Received signal: 11
```

Crashes in libunwind somewhere.

Fully working without issues:

 - Qt Framework (except Web Engine)
 - KDE Frameworks
 - KDE Plasma Desktop
 - KDE Apps
 - many Qt applications
 - i3
 - Wayland
 - Vulkan (with one exception, see below)
 - fcitx (including all plugins; mozc, pinyin, ...)
 - GNU/binutils (compiled with LLVM toolchain)
 - GNU/coreutils (compiled with LLVM toolchain)
 - Bash shell
 - Zsh shell
 - Gtk+ Framework
 - GtkMM (C++ bindings)
 - Python (and so Portage)
 - Ruby
 - Perl
 - Rust (still depends on libgcc_s for some reason :thinking: )
 - NetworkManager
 - ModemManager
 - *and many more...* (can't maintain a full list here)


Not working, needs debugging and probably patches:

I'm compiling these packages with gcc and they are working, but it
is wasteful to load 2 standard libraries into memory at the same time.

 - Linux kernel obviously, same for kernel modules
 - NVIDIA drivers (because kernel module)
 - X11 (works on FreeBSD though which also uses LLVM by default)
 - X11 drivers
 - some X11 libs
 - MariaDB
 - LibreOffice
 - Oracle DB Library (some packages depend on it, some with USE flags, some with a hard dependency)
 - Polkit
 - `media-libs/vulkan-loader`
 - Wine
