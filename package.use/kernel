# remove firmware to avoid conflicts with external firmware
# handling tools which contains everything and not just a
# very minimal subset of firmware files
# Gentoo, what are you doing????

# > missing firmware files for my hardware (gentoo firmware packages)
# iwlwifi ucode 8000C 36 (gentoo package only contains a very ancient version)
# bluetooth (missing in bluez-firmware)
# sound card (missing in alsa-firmware)

# solution:
# install Arch's pacman and install the linux-firmware package
# problem solved âœ“
#
# don't forget to copy over the files from /var/chroot/archlinux/
# when installing stuff with pacman in Gentoo
