regedit util fails to link with both, LLVM/LLD and GNU linkers
the error literally makes no sense and I can't wrap my mind around it
hopefully this util is not mandatory so I can just get rid of it
to make samba compile and link with my LLVM toolchain

those linker errors are getting more weird day by day :/

side node: I even tried to compile with GCC and it failed too
