Brings back the old notification behavior where the notification
history didn't existed or could be disabled globally in the settings.

The new notification system is too much "mobile experience" and
unsuitable for desktop and laptop workstations in my opinion. You
basically need to clear the notification history constantly multiple
times per minute if you get lots of automated notifications from your system.

The patch works for normal notifications and for job notifications.
Also the urgency of all notifications is forced to "normal".
