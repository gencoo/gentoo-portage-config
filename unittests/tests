Compile those programs and see if they are working correctly.
When the toolchain is broken or buggy, it miscompiles the source code
and produces faulty machine code which makes the program crash or act weird.


net-libs/nodejs
   compile a C++ native extension and test it
   if you get "Error: Module did not self-register." the
   compiler produces faulty machine code
   test works best with the sass package
