#=media-gfx/imagemagick-7.0.9.14

# OpenMP bricked again in this version, do the developers even test LLVM/omp??? I don't think so...
# (Assertion failure at kmp_tasking.cpp(3545): task_team == this_thr->th.th_task_team.)
#=media-gfx/imagemagick-7.0.10.0

# note: in case anyone actually reading this, GNU/omp works, but LLVM/omp doesn't in those versions,
# because the developers don't give a shit about clang and LLVM runtimes apparently
# I fucking hate GNU violating standards every day and making platform agnostic development harder as necessary
