# CUDA nvcc works just fine with clang and is easier to install side-by-side with older versions
# than GCC which takes years to compile and mostly fails due to sanity checks with GLIBC(XX) symbols
# lock this dependency of an older GCC version to prevent install attempts which fails with a SIGSEGV in "ar"
# note: the build process seems to scan system libraries against the stage1 libstdc++.so which lacks the
# current GLIBC symbols obviously and than refuses to continue
